# Roman Numerals Kata

Sandi Metz's mailout [Chainline #9](http://us3.campaign-archive2.com/?u=1090565ccff48ac602d0a84b4&id=24e2bac263&e=c8d8b71822) discussed the [Roman Numerals Test on Exercism](https://github.com/alxndr/exercism/blob/master/ruby/roman-numerals/roman_numerals_test.rb)

I thought I'd give it a try before reading the entire mailout, and without looking at Sandi's solution, then compare what I had done to hers.
This is my take on it.

I was interested by her final point on it, which was "search for the abstractions that let you treat everything the same."
I did that, but came up with a completely different abstraction than Sandi had.
